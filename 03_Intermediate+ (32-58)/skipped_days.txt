# Skipped or Incomplete Days â€“ 100 Days of Python

This file explains why some days in the challenge don't have associated projects or are incomplete.

---
Day 49 - Automating Job Applications on LinkedIn
Day 50 - Auto TInder Swiping Bot
Day 51 - Internet Speed Twitter Complain Bot
Day 52 - Instagram Follower Bot

The days listed above were primarily focused on practicing Web Scraping, which was previously covered in other projects,
so I have chose to skip them in favor of tackling more challenging projects ahead.
