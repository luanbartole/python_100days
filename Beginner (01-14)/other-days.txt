Day 06 - Python Functions and Karel
I learned about the for loop and applied programming logic in an interactive maze game as part of the course.

Day 13 - Debugging
I studied debugging techniques, including how to identify errors, use try and except, and leverage the debugger in IDEs.

Day 14 - Higher Lower Game
Since this day focused on creating another game to reinforce previous concepts, I chose to skip it in favor of tackling
more challenging projects ahead.
