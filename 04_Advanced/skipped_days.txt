# Skipped or Incomplete Days – 100 Days of Python

This file explains why some days in the challenge don't have associated projects or are incomplete.

---

Day 70 – Git, GitHub and Version Control  
Learned about version control concepts and basic Git/GitHub commands. No specific project was created for this day.

Day 71 – Deploying Your Web Application  
Successfully deployed the blog app from Day 69 using Render (free tier). Project was hosted on GitHub and connected to
a live database. The deployment was temporary due to free trial limitations. Since the app was the same as Day 69, no
new code was created.

Days 72–81 – Data Science (Disclaimer)  
These lessons introduced data science topics and projects, but due to a lack of foundational math and statistics
knowledge, I was not able to fully grasp or engage with the material. I followed along by copying the code to
familiarize myself with the syntax and tools but did not create original projects. I’ve kept these files for future
reference and plan to revisit this section once I’ve built up the necessary background.
