1. Create a Choropleth to display data on a map.

2. Create bar charts showing different segments of the data with plotly.

3. Create Sunburst charts with plotly.

4. Use Seaborn's .lmplot() and show best-fit lines across multiple categories using the row, hue, and lowess parameters.

5. Understand how a different picture emerges when looking at the same data in different ways (e.g., box plots vs a time series analysis).

6. See the distribution of our data and visualise descriptive statistics with the help of a histogram in Seaborn.
